##  Why I write software

My passion is in improving how people live and work through technology. This led me to work in technology consultancy, product management, and finally software development, where I have discovered how fulfilling it is to engineer a product, and write code that is elegant, flexible, and scalable. 

As a next step, I’m keen to work in a fantastic team where I can deliver impactful, interesting products, and really develop my skills.



## What I can bring to your team

I'm very capable at solving problems. With my background in consultancy and product management, I'm able to quickly understand a domain, break down and prioritise the user's problems, and identify the best and fastest route to making an impact. 

Whilst I've learned many good project practices and toolsets, my most valuable asset is an agile mindset. I've learned to continously inspect our (my team's) approach and work with them to identify improvements. I can readily adopt new practices and adapt existing ones. I can challenge current thinking where appropriate, and I welcome challenges from others. 

I strive to apply this thinking to my code. In my first six months as a developer, I taught myself Node, Vue, Python and Mongo, and learned and implemented BDD (Mocha, Vue Test Utils), continous integration (Codeship), and cloud hosting (Heroku, Firebase, AWS). I read up on best practices (e.g. Clean Code, Node JS Design Patterns, The Way of the Web Tester) and found an online mentor to review my code. 



## My experience

**Web Developer - Spacelab (Jan 2018 - Nov 2018)**

**Activity:** Developing new web and Unity apps

- **Example:** Developed analytics app which retrieves (from 3rd party API) location data of staff in a given space, then converts this into analysis for property managers, so they can see how the space is being used and adapt it to better fit the occupants’ needs.

- **Impact:** App completed and tested live at Spacelab.

- **Example:** Cost predictor to be used by construction teams to quickly provide estimates to clients. The user inputs a set of parameters about the project, and the predictor provides a prediction by comparing those against historic data from completed projects. Developed frontend (Vue) and API (Python - Flask) to query the machine learning model (developed by our data scientist). 

- **Impact:** App developed and demoed to quantity surveyors, contractors, and architects, who are keen to use it once there is sufficient historic data.

-	**Example:** Developed VR 360 photo app (Unity) for interior designers, enabling them to present their designs in VR to a whole group simultaneously. 

-	**Impact:** Enabled clients who used it to collectively experience and discuss the design in VR, which resulted in a much more productive discussion.


**Product Owner – Spacelab (Dec 2016 - Jan 2018)**

**Activity:** Designing new products to support Spacelab team

-	**Example:** Designed and led delivery for new presentation web app, where the team could upload their research data on how the client’s office was being used into the app and send link to the client

-	**Impact:** Significantly reduced the manual effort involved in producing analytics presentations (e.g. in InDesign) and provided an improved client experience over circulating documents

**Activity:** Implementing Agile practices into interior design projects – teaching designers to research user needs, test designs by reviewing them with users in VR, use stand-ups and retrospectives etc.


**Product Owner – Media Technology Team, QVC (Jan 2014 - Nov 2016)**

**Activity:** Designing new products to support creation and distribution of content

-	**Example:** Defined global strategy for on-screen graphics, to replace the different systems used by the seven QVC markets with a new graphics preparation and playout solution across all channels. 

-	**Impact:** As well as replacing end-of-life applications and providing key new graphics features, the common code base and single development team will enable much faster delivery of new features.

**Activity:** Reorganising team’s dev ops and project management processes - in particular leading the implementation of Scrum into the team and reorganising the project planning process.


**IT Consultant – Deloitte (Sept 2012 - Dec 2014)**

**Activity:** Worked on Digital Channels programme for Lloyds Banking Group, to migrate their corporate clients from the legacy online banking channels to a new strategic channel. Defined requirements for the new channel and the IT solution (ETL tool) to migrate customers, and carried out supporting SQL and Excel analysis to understand customer usage of the existing channels.


**Analyst – Investment Services Team (IST), PA Consulting (Aug 2011 - Aug 2012)**

**English Teacher and Documentary Film-maker – Accra, Ghana	(Jan 2007 – May 2007)**

**Film Director – Transgressive North	(2007 – 2010)**
