###  What I'm about

My passion is in improving how people live and work through technology. This led me to work in technology consultancy, product management, and finally software development, where I have discovered how fulfilling it is to engineer a product - crafting it to be elegant, flexible, and scalable. 

I constantly drive to learn new technologies – for example teaching myself front and backend development (Node, Vue, Python, Mongo, various SQL technologies), TDD and BDD (using Jest, Vue Test Utils, Mocha, Sinon), continuous integration (Codeship and Github), and cloud hosting (Heroku, Firebase, AWS).

I strive to write clean, loosely-coupled, and flexible components, by reading up on best practices (e.g. Clean Code, Node JS Design Patterns, The Way of the Web Tester) and organising code reviews. All of my apps have unit and end-to-end tests (Nightwatch), built into continuous integration pipelines with staging environments. 

As a next step, I’m keen to work in a fantastic team where I can deliver and maintain impactful, interesting products, and really develop my skills. 

### My experience

**Web Developer - Spacelab (Jan 2018 - Nov 2018)**

**Activity:** Developing new web and Unity apps

- **Example:** Developing analytics app which retrieves (from 3rd party API) location data of staff in a given space, then converts this into meaningful analysis for property managers, so they can see how the space is being used and adapt it to better fit the occupants’ needs.

- **Impact:** App completed and tested live at Spacelab.

- **Example:** Cost predictor to be used by construction teams to quickly provide estimates to clients. The user inputs a set of parameters about the project, and the predictor provides a prediction by comparing those against historic data from completed projects. Developed frontend (Vue) and API (Python - Flask) to query the machine learning model (developed by our data scientist). 

- **Impact:** App developed and demoed to quantity surveyors, contractors, and architects, who are keen to use it once there is sufficient historic data.

-	**Example:** Developed VR 360 photo app (Unity) for interior designers, enabling them to present their designs in VR to a whole group simultaneously. 

-	**Impact:** Enabled clients who used it to collectively experience and discuss the design in VR, which resulted in a much more productive discussion.

**Product Owner – Spacelab (Dec 2016 - Jan 2018)**

**Activity:** Designing new products to support Spacelab team

-	**Example:** Designed and led delivery for new presentation web app, where the team could upload their research data on how the client’s office was being used into the app and send link to the client

-	**Impact:** Significantly reduced the manual effort involved in producing analytics presentations (e.g. in InDesign) and provided an improved client experience over circulating documents
