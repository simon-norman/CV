## Simon Norman, Full Stack Junior Developer


##  Why I write software


My passion is in making people's lives better through technology. This led me to work in technology consultancy, product management, and engineering, where I have discovered how fulfilling it is to craft a product, and write code that is elegant, flexible, and scalable. 

I'm now looking for a fantastic team where I can deliver impactful, interesting products, and really develop my skills. 



## What I can bring to your team


**Problem solving**: With my background in consultancy and product management, I'm able to quickly understand a domain, break down and prioritise the user's problems, and identify the best and fastest route to making an impact. 

**An agile mindset:** I've learned to continously inspect our (my team's) approach and work with them to identify improvements. I can readily adopt new practices and adapt existing ones. I can challenge existing thinking, and welcome challenges from others. 

I strive to apply this thinking to my code. In my first six months as a developer, I taught myself Node, Vue, Python and Mongo, and learned and implemented BDD (Mocha, Vue Test Utils), continous integration (Codeship), and cloud hosting (Heroku, Firebase, AWS). I read up on best practices (e.g. Clean Code, Node JS Design Patterns, The Way of the Web Tester) and found an online mentor to review my code. 

**Excellent communicator**: 



## My experience


### Web Developer - Spacelab (Jan 2018 - Nov 2018)

**Activity:** Developing new web and Unity apps

- **Example:** Developed analytics app which retrieves (from 3rd party API) location data of staff in a given space, then converts this into analysis for property managers, so they can see how the space is being used and adapt it to better fit the occupants’ needs.

- **Impact:** App completed and tested live at Spacelab.

- **Example:** Cost predictor to be used by construction teams to quickly provide estimates to clients, by using historic data from completed projects to make predictions. Developed frontend and api to query the machine learning model.

- **Impact:** App developed and demoed to quantity surveyors, contractors, and architects, who are keen to use it once there is sufficient historic data.

-	**Example:** Developed VR 360 photo app (Unity) for interior designers, enabling them to present their designs in VR to a whole group simultaneously. 

-	**Impact:** Enabled clients who used it to collectively experience and discuss the design in VR, which resulted in a much more productive discussion.


### Product Owner – Spacelab (Dec 2016 - Jan 2018)

**Activity:** Designing new products to support Spacelab team

-	**Example:** Designed and led delivery for new presentation web app, where the team could upload their research data on how the client’s office was being used into the app and send link to the client

-	**Impact:** Significantly reduced the manual effort involved in producing analytics presentations (e.g. in InDesign) and provided an improved client experience over circulating documents

**Activity:** Implementing Agile practices into interior design projects – teaching designers to research user needs, test designs by reviewing them with users in VR, use stand-ups and retrospectives etc.


### Product Owner – Media Technology Team, QVC (Jan 2014 - Nov 2016)

**Activity:** Designing new products to support creation and distribution of content

-	**Example:** Defined global strategy for on-screen graphics, to replace the different systems used by the seven QVC markets with a new graphics preparation and playout solution across all channels. 

-	**Impact:** As well as replacing end-of-life applications and providing key new graphics features, the common code base and single development team will enable much faster delivery of new features.

**Activity:** Reorganising team’s dev ops and project management processes - in particular leading the implementation of Scrum into the team and reorganising the project planning process.


### IT Consultant – Deloitte (Sept 2012 - Dec 2014)
