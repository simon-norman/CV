My passion is in improving how people live and work through technology. This led me to work in technology consultancy, product management, and finally software development, where I have discovered how fulfilling it is to engineer a product - crafting it to be elegant, flexible, and scalable. 

I constantly drive to learn new technologies – for example teaching myself front and backend development (Node, Vue, Python, Mongo, various SQL technologies), TDD and BDD (using Jest, Vue Test Utils, Mocha, Sinon), continuous integration (Codeship and Github), and cloud hosting (Heroku, Firebase, AWS).

I strive to write clean, loosely-coupled, and flexible components, by reading up on best practices (e.g. Clean Code, Node JS Design Patterns, The Way of the Web Tester) and organising code reviews. All of my apps have unit and end-to-end tests (Nightwatch), built into continuous integration pipelines with staging environments. 

As a next step, I’m keen to work in a fantastic team where I can deliver and maintain impactful, interesting products, and really develop my skills.
